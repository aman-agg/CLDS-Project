The main file is main.java
The sequential implementation is stored in SequentialRtree.java
The lock based implementation is stored in LockBasedRtree.java
The lock free implementation is stored in LockFreeRtree.java

In main.java, we have function to run each implementation
use runSequentialRtree() to run sequential implementation,
use lockBasedRtree() to run lock based implementation and 
use lockFreeRtree() to run lock free implementation. 

In lock free and lock based implementation, we have default values as inputs which can be changed in respective run() functions of the classes.
